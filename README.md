This is a Hangman Game Project. From a set of randmom words a word will be chosen and the player will have to guess the word. For every wrong guess of the letters the image will slowly grow from hanging rope to a hangning man. A total of 6 wrong guesses will mean that he lost the game and an image of hanging will be displayed. If the player guesses the correct word he will be decalred as winner. The buttons are disabled once they are clicked by the user. A reset button is provided to restart the game.
